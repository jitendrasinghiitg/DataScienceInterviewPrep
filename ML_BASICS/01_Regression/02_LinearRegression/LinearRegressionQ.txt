Explain the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.	**Answer:** Simple linear regression involves one independent variable to predict a dependent variable, whereas multiple linear regression involves two or more independent variables to predict a dependent variable. The former fits a straight line (y = mx + c) while the latter fits a hyperplane in a multidimensional space.
Why do we use the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method in linear regression?	**Answer:** OLS minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed dependent variable and those predicted by the linear function. It provides the best linear unbiased estimates of the coefficients, assuming the error terms are normally distributed and homoscedastic.
Describe the assumptions made by linear regression.	**Answer:** 1. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear. 2. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. 3. Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of the errors. 4. Normality: Errors are normally distributed. 5. No multicollinearity: Independent variables are not highly correlated.
What are the consequences of violating linear regression assumptions?	**Answer:** Violating assumptions can lead to biased or inefficient estimates. For instance: - Non-linearity can cause systematic underfitting. - Independence violations (e.g., autocorrelation) lead to underestimation of standard errors. - Heteroscedasticity results in inefficient estimates and invalid hypothesis tests. - Non-normality affects confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. - Multicollinearity inflates variance of coefficient estimates, making them unstable.
How do you interpret the coefficients in a linear regression model?	**Answer:** Coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, holding all other variables constant. For instance, in a model \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 \), \(\beta_1\) is the change in \(y\) for a one-unit change in \(x_1\).
What is gradient descent and how is it used in linear regression?	**Answer:** Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function. In linear regression, it iteratively adjusts the model coefficients to reduce the sum of squared residuals by moving in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function.
Explain the concept of regularization and how it is applied in linear regression.	**Answer:** Regularization involves adding a penalty term to the cost function to prevent overfitting. In linear regression, common techniques include: - **Ridge Regression (L2 regularization):** Adds a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. - **Lasso Regression (L1 regularization):** Adds a penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, which can lead to sparse models with fewer predictors.
Compare and contrast Lasso and Ridge regression.	**Answer:** - **Lasso (L1):** Can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing variable selection. - **Ridge (L2):** Shrinks coefficients but doesn’t eliminate any; useful when all predictors need to be retained. - **Elastic Net:** Combines L1 and L2 penalties to benefit from both techniques.
How do you handle multicollinearity in linear regression?	**Answer:** 1. Remove highly correlated predictors. 2. Combine correlated predictors (e.g., principal component analysis). 3. Use regularization techniques like Ridge regression which can handle multicollinearity by penalizing large coefficients.
Describe the process of feature selection in the context of linear regression.	**Answer:** Feature selection can be done using: 1. **Filter methods:** Statistical tests to rank and select features (e.g., correlation coefficient, chi-square test). 2. **Wrapper methods:** Use model performance to evaluate feature subsets (e.g., forward selection, backward elimination). 3. **Embedded methods:** Perform feature selection during model training (e.g., Lasso).
How do you choose the best features for your linear regression model?	**Answer:** - Use domain knowledge to select relevant features. - Perform exploratory data analysis to understand relationships. - Apply feature selection methods (filter, wrapper, embedded). - Evaluate model performance using cross-validation with different feature subsets.
Discuss a scenario where linear regression might fail and suggest an alternative approach.	**Answer:** Linear regression fails when relationships are non-linear. For example, predicting housing prices where price growth accelerates over time. An alternative approach could be polynomial regression or non-linear models like decision trees or neural networks.
How do you handle categorical variables in linear regression?	**Answer:** Categorical variables can be converted into numerical values using: - **One-hot encoding:** Creates binary columns for each category. - **Label encoding:** Assigns a unique number to each category. - **Target encoding:** Uses the mean of the target variable for each category.

How do you interpret the intercept in a linear regression model?	**Answer:** The intercept is the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. It represents the baseline level of the outcome variable.
What is the difference between correlation and causation in the context of linear regression?	**Answer:** Correlation indicates a relationship between variables, whereas causation implies one variable causes a change in another. Linear regression can identify correlations but establishing causation requires additional experiments or evidence.
How do you test for autocorrelation in linear regression residuals?	**Answer:** 1. **Durbin-Watson test:** A value close to 2 indicates no autocorrelation. 2. **Plot residuals:** Identify patterns over time. 3. **Ljung-Box test:** Checks for autocorrelation in residuals at multiple lags.
What is the purpose of using a log transformation in linear regression?	**Answer:** Log transformation can: 1. Linearize relationships. 2. Stabilize variance (address heteroscedasticity). 3. Normalize the distribution of variables.
Explain the difference between a confidence interval and a prediction interval in linear regression.	**Answer:** - **Confidence Interval:** Range within which the true population parameter lies with a certain probability. - **Prediction Interval:** Range within which a new observation will fall with a certain probability, accounting for both parameter and observation variability.
How would you address model interpretability in a linear regression with many features?	**Answer:** 1. Use regularization to shrink less important coefficients. 2. Perform feature selection to retain only significant features. 3. Visualize coefficients and their impacts. 4. Simplify the model by combining correlated features.
Describe the impact of outliers on a linear regression model.	**Answer:** Outliers can skew coefficients, leading to biased and misleading estimates. They increase the error variance and reduce the predictive power of the model. Robust regression techniques or transformation methods are often used to mitigate their impact.
What are the potential issues with using highly correlated predictors in a linear regression model?	**Answer:** - Multicollinearity: Leads to inflated standard errors and unstable coefficients. - Redundancy: Reduces model interpretability and predictive power. - Overfitting: Model may perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
How do you interpret the R-squared value in the context of model fit?	**Answer:** R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables. A higher R-squared indicates a better fit, but it doesn’t imply causation or model quality alone.
Explain the purpose of using dummy variables in linear regression.	**Answer:** Dummy variables allow categorical data to be included in the regression model by converting categories into binary (0 or 1) indicators. This enables the model to account for categorical differences.
How do you evaluate the performance of a linear regression model on a test set?	**Answer:** - Calculate performance metrics (R-squared, RMSE, MAE) on the test set. - Plot predicted vs. actual values to assess fit. - Check residuals for patterns indicating potential model issues. - Compare model performance to baseline models.
What is the purpose of using cross-validation in model selection?	**Answer:** Cross-validation helps in assessing how the model generalizes to unseen data, preventing overfitting. It divides data into multiple subsets, training on some and validating on others, providing a more reliable performance estimate.
How would you handle a large number of predictors in a linear regression model?	**Answer:** 1. Apply feature selection methods. 2. Use regularization techniques like Lasso or Ridge. 3. Reduce dimensionality using techniques like PCA. 4. Evaluate model complexity and remove redundant features.

Detection methods include: - Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): Values > 10 indicate multicollinearity. - Correlation matrix: High correlations among predictors.
How do you interpret the p-value of an individual predictor in linear regression?	**Answer:** The p-value tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient is zero. A low p-value (< 0.05) indicates that the predictor is statistically significant, suggesting it contributes to the model.
What is the impact of omitting a relevant variable from a linear regression model?	**Answer:** Omitting a relevant variable can lead to omitted variable bias, resulting in biased and inconsistent coefficient estimates. It reduces the explanatory power and accuracy of the model.
Describe the role of the F-test in linear regression.	**Answer:** The F-test assesses the overall significance of the regression model. It tests whether at least one predictor variable is significantly related to the dependent variable. A significant F-test (p-value < 0.05) indicates that the model provides a better fit than a model with no predictors.
