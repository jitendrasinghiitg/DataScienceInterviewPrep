# k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Interview Questions

### Algorithm

1. **What is the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm?**
   **Answer:** k-NN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It predicts the output based on the majority class or average of the k-nearest training data points.

2. **How does the k-NN algorithm work?**
   **Answer:** k-NN works by finding the k-nearest neighbors of a query point in the feature space and making predictions based on the majority class (classification) or the average value (regression) of these neighbors.

3. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of k-NN?**
   **Answer:** Advantages include simplicity, ease of implementation, and no need for training. Disadvantages include high computational cost for large datasets, sensitivity to irrelevant features, and the curse of dimensionality.

4. **How do you choose the value of k in k-NN?**
   **Answer:** The value of k is chosen based on cross-validation. A small k can lead to noise sensitivity, while a large k can smooth out the predictions too much.

5. **What is the curse of dimensionality, and how does it affect k-NN?**
   **Answer:** The curse of dimensionality refers to the exponential increase in data sparsity as the number of dimensions increases, making distance metrics less meaningful and negatively affecting k-NN performance.

6. **What are distance metrics in k-NN, and why are they important?**
   **Answer:** Distance metrics, such as Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski distances, measure the similarity between data points. They are crucial for identifying the nearest neighbors accurately.

7. **How does k-NN handle categorical features?**
   **Answer:** k-NN can handle categorical features by using distance metrics that accommodate categorical data, such as Hamming distance, or by converting categorical features into numerical values through encoding.

8. **What is weighted k-NN, and how does it differ from standard k-NN?**
   **Answer:** Weighted k-NN assigns different weights to neighbors based on their distance from the query point, giving closer neighbors more influence on the prediction than farther ones.

9. **How does the choice of distance metric affect k-NN performance?**
   **Answer:** The choice of distance metric affects the identification of nearest neighbors. Different metrics may work better for different types of data, influencing the model's accuracy and robustness.

10. **Can k-NN be used for both classification and regression tasks?**
    **Answer:** Yes, k-NN can be used for both classification (predicting categorical outcomes) and regression (predicting continuous outcomes).

### Implementation

11. **How do you implement k-NN in Python using scikit-learn?**
    **Answer:** You can implement k-NN using the `KNeighborsClassifier` or `KNeighborsRegressor` class in scikit-learn. Example:
    ```python
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
    model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    ```

12. **What are the key hyperparameters to tune in a k-NN model?**
    **Answer:** Key hyperparameters include the number of neighbors (`n_neighbors`), the distance metric (`metric`), and the weighting function (`weights`).

13. **How do you handle large datasets with k-NN?**
    **Answer:** Handle large datasets by using approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms, data reduction techniques, or parallel processing to reduce computational costs.

14. **What is the role of the `algorithm` parameter in scikit-learn's k-NN implementation?**
    **Answer:** The `algorithm` parameter specifies the algorithm to compute nearest neighbors (`'auto'`, `'ball_tree'`, `'kd_tree'`, `'brute'`). It affects the efficiency of the search.

15. **How do you normalize features for k-NN?**
    **Answer:** Normalize features by scaling them to a common range (e.g., using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler in scikit-learn) to ensure that no single feature dominates the distance calculations.

16. **What is the effect of the `leaf_size` parameter in k-NN?**
    **Answer:** The `leaf_size` parameter affects the speed and memory usage of tree-based algorithms (`ball_tree`, `kd_tree`). Smaller leaf sizes can increase the search efficiency but also increase memory usage.

17. **How do you handle imbalanced datasets in k-NN?**
    **Answer:** Handle imbalanced datasets by using techniques like resampling, adjusting class weights, or using weighted k-NN to give more importance to minority class neighbors.

18. **What is the impact of feature selection on k-NN?**
    **Answer:** Feature selection improves k-NN performance by removing irrelevant or redundant features, reducing dimensionality, and enhancing the significance of distance metrics.

19. **How do you evaluate the computational complexity of k-NN?**
    **Answer:** The computational complexity of k-NN is O(n * d) for distance calculation and O(k * log(n)) for sorting, where n is the number of training samples and d is the number of features.

20. **What is the role of the `p` parameter in the Minkowski distance for k-NN?**
    **Answer:** The `p` parameter in the Minkowski distance defines the distance metric: p=1 for Manhattan distance, p=2 for Euclidean distance. It allows for flexible distance calculations.

### Hyperparameters

21. **How do you perform hyperparameter tuning for k-NN using grid search?**
    **Answer:** Use `GridSearchCV` in scikit-learn to search over hyperparameter values. Example:
    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    parameters = {'n_neighbors': [3, 5, 7], 'weights': ['uniform', 'distance']}
    model = KNeighborsClassifier()
    clf = GridSearchCV(model, parameters)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

22. **What is the purpose of using cross-validation in k-NN?**
    **Answer:** Cross-validation provides a reliable estimate of the model's performance by splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times, helping to avoid overfitting.

23. **How do you choose the best distance metric for k-NN?**
    **Answer:** Choose the best distance metric based on the nature of the data and through cross-validation to evaluate different metrics' performance.

24. **What is the impact of the `metric_params` parameter in k-NN?**
    **Answer:** The `metric_params` parameter allows for additional parameters to be passed to the distance metric function, enabling customization for specific distance calculations.

25. **How does the choice of weighting function (`weights`) affect k-NN performance?**
    **Answer:** The weighting function affects the influence of neighbors on the prediction. `uniform` gives equal weight to all neighbors, while `distance` gives more weight to closer neighbors.

26. **What is the effect of the `n_jobs` parameter in k-NN?**
    **Answer:** The `n_jobs` parameter specifies the number of parallel jobs to run for the neighbor search. Setting `n_jobs=-1` uses all available CPU cores, speeding up computation.

27. **How do you implement weighted k-NN in scikit-learn?**
    **Answer:** Set the `weights` parameter to `'distance'` in the `KNeighborsClassifier` or `KNeighborsRegressor` class to implement weighted k-NN. Example:
    ```python
    model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3, weights='distance')
    ```

28. **How do you use k-NN for multi-class classification?**
    **Answer:** k-NN inherently supports multi-class classification by considering the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors, even when there are more than two classes.

29. **How do you handle ties in k-NN classification?**
    **Answer:** Handle ties by using a weighting function to prioritize closer neighbors or by choosing the class with the smallest label or using domain-specific rules.

30. **How does feature scaling impact k-NN performance?**
    **Answer:** Feature scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the distance metric, preventing features with larger scales from dominating the distance calculations.

31. **What are the implications of a very large k value in k-NN?**
    **Answer:** A very large k value can lead to over-smoothing, where the predictions are averaged over many neighbors, potentially missing finer details and trends in the data.

32. **What are the implications of a very small k value in k-NN?**
    **Answer:** A very small k value can make the model sensitive to noise and outliers, leading to overfitting and poor generalization to new data.

33. **How do you determine the appropriate `leaf_size` for tree-based k-NN algorithms?**
    **Answer:** Determine `leaf_size` by experimenting with different values and using cross-validation to find the best trade-off between search efficiency and memory usage.

34. **How does the `metric` hyperparameter affect the k-NN model?**
    **Answer:** The `metric` hyperparameter determines the distance measure used to identify nearest neighbors. Different metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) can significantly impact the model's performance depending on the data characteristics.

35. **What is the role of `metric_params` in fine-tuning k-NN models?**
    **Answer:** `metric_params` allows for additional customization of the distance metric, enabling fine-tuning for specific needs and improving model performance.
